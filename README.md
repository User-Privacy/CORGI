## Brief Intro ##
CORGI ( Cust Omizable Robust Geo Indistinguishability), a framework for generating location obfuscation with strong privacy guarantees (based on Geo-Ind) that effectively allows users to balance the trade-off between privacy, utility, and customization. CORGI utilizes an untrusted server for performing the computationally heavy task of generating the obfuscation function while ensuring the privacy of the user. In order to do so, CORGI uses a tree structure which is a semantic representation of a given region that assists users in specifying their customization preferences. These preferences are used to select the obfuscation range and granularity of location sharing and are only selectively shared with the server so as to protect the privacy of the user e.g., only the number of locations to be removed from the obfuscation range and not the exact locations. The CORGI generates a robust obfuscation function on the server side which satisfies the Geo-Ind requirements after user customization i.e., removal of locations that do not satisfy the Boolean predicates. In order to generate this robust function efficiently, CORGI minimizes the number of constraints by using a graph approximation. The experimental results on a real dataset show that the robust obfuscation function generated by CORGI is customizable with only minimal loss in utility compared to the traditional approaches which are not robustagainst customization.
